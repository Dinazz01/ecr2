AWS CloudFront is a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that securely delivers content (websites, APIs, videos, or container images) with low latency and high transfer speeds. Here's how it works and why it's valuable for your ECR module integration:

Key Features of AWS CloudFront
Global Edge Network

Uses 300+ Points of Presence (PoPs) worldwide to cache content closer to users.

Reduces latency when delivering container images from ECR.

Security Integration

Enforces HTTPS (TLS encryption) by default.

Supports AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) to block malicious traffic.

Integrates with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.

Performance Optimization

Caches frequently accessed container images at edge locations.

Supports HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 (QUIC) for faster transfers.

Origin Flexibility

Can pull content from AWS services (like ECR) or custom origins (on-prem servers).

Why Integrate CloudFront with ECR?
Faster Container Pulls

Cached container layers (docker pull) are served from edge locations closer to users (e.g., Kubernetes clusters in different regions).

Reduced ECR Costs

Fewer direct requests to ECR (cached requests at edge don’t hit ECR).

Enhanced Security

Hide ECR behind CloudFront (origin shielding).

Enforce HTTPS and attach WAF rules to block malicious pulls.

Compliance

Meet requirements for encrypted content delivery and audit logging.




A user (or Kubernetes node) requests a container image via CloudFront URL.

If cached, CloudFront serves it from the nearest edge location.

If not cached, CloudFront fetches it from ECR (over HTTPS).

CloudFront caches the image layers at edge locations for future requests.

Key CloudFront Configurations in Your ECR Module
Origin Configuration

hcl
origin {
  domain_name = replace(aws_ecr_repository.this.repository_url, "https://", "")
  origin_id   = "ecr-${aws_ecr_repository.this.name}"
  custom_origin_config {
    https_port             = 443
    origin_protocol_policy = "https-only"  # Force HTTPS to ECR
  }
}
Security Policies

Enforce HTTPS:

hcl
viewer_protocol_policy = "redirect-to-https"
WAF Integration:

hcl
web_acl_id = aws_wafv2_web_acl.cdn_acl.arn  # Attach WAF to block exploits
Caching Rules

Cache container layers (optimize docker pull):

hcl
default_ttl = 86400  # Cache for 24 hours
Use Cases for ECR + CloudFront
Global Kubernetes Clusters

Speed up docker pull across regions by caching images at edge locations.

CI/CD Pipelines

Reduce pull times for build agents distributed worldwide.

Air-Gapped Environments

Use CloudFront as a controlled gateway to ECR with audit logs.

Secure Internal Distribution

Restrict access via CloudFront signed URLs or OAI (Origin Access Identity).

Example: Pulling Images via CloudFront
bash
# Instead of pulling directly from ECR:
docker pull 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-repo:latest

# Pull through CloudFront (faster for distributed teams):
docker pull d1234.cloudfront.net/my-repo:latest
Pricing Considerations
CloudFront Costs:

Data transfer out ($0.085–0.02/GB, reduces with volume).

HTTP/HTTPS requests ($0.0075–0.01 per 10k requests).

Savings:

Reduced ECR data transfer costs (cached requests don’t hit ECR).

By integrating CloudFront with your ECR module, you combine AWS's secure container registry with global CDN performance, while enforcing compliance through Sentinel policies. This is ideal for teams needing fast, secure container distribution at scale.

Here's a clear guide to integrating CloudFront with your ECR module, including implementation steps and key considerations:

Core CloudFront Resource (add to cloudfront.tf)

terraform
resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "ecr_cdn" {
  count = var.enable_cloudfront ? 1 : 0

  origin {
    domain_name = replace(aws_ecr_repository.this.repository_url, "https://", "")

      https_port             = 443
      origin_protocol_policy = "https-only"
      origin_ssl_protocols   = ["TLSv1.2"]
    }
  }

  repository = aws_ecr_repository.this.name
  
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",

      {
        Effect = "Allow",
        Principal = {
          Service = "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
        },
        Action = [
          "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
          "ecr:BatchGetImage"
        ],
        Condition = {
          StringEquals = {
            "AWS:SourceArn" = aws_cloudfront_distribution.ecr_cdn[0].arn
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  })
}
Key Integration Points
Security Controls

terraform
# Enforce HTTPS only
viewer_protocol_policy = "redirect-to-https"

# Attach WAF for DDoS protection
web_acl_id = var.cloudfront_waf_acl_arn

# Restrict geographic distribution if needed
geo_restriction {
  restriction_type = "blacklist"
  locations        = ["CN", "RU"]
}
Performance Optimization

terraform
# Cache settings for container layers
default_cache_behavior {
  default_ttl = 86400  # 24 hours for immutable tags
  max_ttl     = 604800 # 7 days maximum
  
  # Important for Docker layers
  smooth_streaming = false
  compress         = true
}
New Module Variables (add to variables.tf)

terraform
variable "enable_cloudfront" {
  description = "Enable CloudFront distribution for ECR"
  type        = bool
  default     = false
}

variable "cloudfront_waf_acl_arn" {
  description = "ARN of WAF ACL to attach to CloudFront"
  type        = string
  default     = ""
}

variable "cloudfront_default_root" {
  description = "Default root object for the distribution"
  type        = string
  default     = ""
}

variable "cloudfront_price_class" {
  description = "CloudFront price class (PriceClass_100|200|All)"
  type        = string
  default     = "PriceClass_100" # US/Europe only
}
Usage Example
terraform
module "cdn_backed_ecr" {
  source = "./modules/secure_ecr"

  # ECR Configuration
  repository_name              = "prod-containers"
  image_tag_mutability_enabled = true
  kms_key_arn                 = aws_kms_key.ecr.arn

  # CloudFront Integration
  enable_cloudfront           = true
  cloudfront_waf_acl_arn      = aws_wafv2_web_acl.ecr_protection.arn
  cloudfront_default_root     = "index.json"
  
  # Optional geo-restrictions
  allowed_regions = ["US", "EU"]
}
Monitoring Setup
CloudFront Metrics

terraform
resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "cdn_4xx_errors" {
  alarm_name          = "${aws_ecr_repository.this.name}-cdn-4xx-errors"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = 1
  metric_name         = "4xxErrorRate"
  namespace          = "AWS/CloudFront"
  period             = 300
  statistic          = "Sum"
  threshold          = 10
  alarm_description  = "Monitor 4xx errors from CloudFront"
  dimensions = {
    DistributionId = aws_cloudfront_distribution.ecr_cdn[0].id
    Region         = "Global"
  }
}
